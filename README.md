# kayakApp
Challenging myself to create an app that: fetches the weather in primary Kayaking hubs in Missouri
Then analyzes temp range , time windows , and wind speed
Then runs conditional logic to determine if ALL criteria is met
If so, returns an image of a kayak and a thumbs up with the message "Let's go Paddlin'!"
Plus a clickable link to get more detailed weather info.
If the conditions do not pass the conditional tests, displays a kayak with a line through it and 
  SOME suggestion of what else you might be interested in doing instead
