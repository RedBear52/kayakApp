# kayakApp
Challenging myself to create an app that: fetches the weather in primary Kayaking hubs in Missouri
Then analyzes temp range , time windows , and wind speed
Then runs conditional logic to determine if ALL criteria is met
If so, returns an image of a kayak and a thumbs up with the message "Let's go Paddlin'!"
Plus a clickable link to get more detailed weather info.
If the conditions do not pass the conditional tests, displays a kayak with a line through it and 
  SOME suggestion of what else you might be interested in doing instead
  
Eventually would like to add additional functionality/complexity by adding in water levels on certain waterways via gov api (if they extist)

Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the initial intention of running it locally and eventually deploying it to the ole world wide web...
